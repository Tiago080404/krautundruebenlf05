## Sprint 1: Discovery Track [23.01. - 27.01.2024]

The focus of this sprint is on gathering knowledge. Tasks include self-study, reading, summarizing, explaining to each other, attending lectures, noting down and clarifying questions. The output is a document summarizing a
[list of essential SQL commands](/sql-commands.md).
We also use the lectures and inputs provided by our teachers to expand our knowledge. During the daily meetings, we focus on explaining to each other what we learned the day before. At the end of the dailys we discuss any blockers we face and work together to resolve them.

In our sprint backlog, we outlined following tasks:

1. **Introduction to Agile Software Development**

   - Focus on Scrum methods to help the team work better together.

2. **Acquire Database Glossary of Basic Terms**

   - Learn and write down the most important database terms.

3. **Build Project Environment**
   - Get tools like GitLab, draw.io and Vite up and running so weâ€™re ready to work.
